Hi all,

Here's the long overdue update. The last update was 2 quarters ago, which is saying something.

### Recap:

At the time of the last update, we had come to a place where the product was almost ready to go to production. I was just starting to take a look at hiring again. The priority was to get to 25 paying users by the end of JAS'23 and to get to 100 by the end of 2023.


### 90 degree turn:

In April, just a couple of weeks after the last update, I chose to accept an inversion of priorities between product launch and hiring due to unaccounted circumstances:

1. I had fixed most of the deal breakers for onboarding designers. But, once they started designing to the T, users were running into a lot of edge case limitations. We had faced all these issues with the beta version before and implemented workarounds, so I knew I had to address them on the new version also at some point. But, I miscalculated their 
urgency for customers.

2. My wife was entering the second trimester of her pregnancy and decided to move to her maternal home. This meant that I had to keep travelling to visit her and also take care of the household myself. I could no longer manage uninterrupted 12 hour work days.

The narrowing of my own bandwidth and the addition of voluminous low complexity work led me to promote hiring to top priority. 

### Academy:

The campus hiring season for the first semester of 2023 was coming to an end. I went to a few colleges, even though I was not very hopeful, just to get a reading of freshers. After exploring the normal campus hiring processes, conducting a hackathon, some 1-1 interviews, mentoring open source contributions and interacting with students personally, I came to the conclusion that the whole approach to hiring needs to be rethought. [Here's a link to the JD used in the process](https://emptycup.notion.site/Full-Stack-Internship-EmptyCup-a8019df1520c4f2a913f517ab0ba2856). 


Working with a couple of colleges and some students, we conceptualized the EmptyCup Academy programme. The 3 month program attempts to hire freshers without interviews by mentoring students on open source projects related to EmptyCup's core platform. Students have to prove themselves through disciplined self study. Preplanned hackathons will serve to evaluate execution capability.

The coming quarter will be focused mainly on hiring. The goal is to get a small team of 3-4 devs ready by January to drive product development.

### Reflection:

I have been reflecting on the calls I made. The more I reflect, the more I find myself in alignment.

I was iffy about prioritising hiring over product launch as it pushes the revenue timelines by a couple of quarters. As I reflect, I'm also realising that this addresses the single point of failure risk for the company to a large extent. I can myself breathe a sigh of relief if the company's success is not dependent solely on my individual efforts.

Another choice that's a question mark is the decision to rethink hiring because innovating in just one aspect of the company (product) itself is risky and expensive. We might be biting off a bit more than we can chew with the Academy programme. But, I'm personally convinced that it's a bet we have to take because I always believed that the only guarentee for the company's success is the the company's culture and culture starts with getting the right people onboard the right way. Only time will tell the cost of living up to that ideal.

I'm also conscious of the possibility that I may be biased in my choices and am only rationalising my choices after the fact. I'm sharing my reflections, so that anyone of you might call it out if something doesn't feel right.


### Roadmap:

Just to keep the summit in view, our endgame is to reach 3Cr in monthly revenue which equates to 10k users at an average monthly revenue of 3k/month. The crucial milestones on that path are sustainability (100 paying users) and profitability (1000 paying users). The closest milestone is 100 paying users which validates the business model and alleviates most of the existential threats. We were hoping to get there by the end of this year. Alas, that's not to be. I'll be happy if we get there by end of AMJ'24.
