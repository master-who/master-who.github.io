## Week 0
<br>

This is the work log for the planning week before the SOND'23 trimester. I expect a lot of this work to be walking blind in the dark. More than anything, I'm hoping to find a rhythm in work and hopefully experience zen. Also, this time around, I want to make it fun.

> "Responsible fun" would be a good idea to explore in text

## Monday:

I have till 6pm today which is 8.5 hours from now. The goal today is to build some good momentum. Let's keep the work intervals short to begin with. 25+5 is a good first bet.


__Round 1:__ Structured the plan a little.
__Round 2:__ Started breaking down the objectives into tasks.


_I feel like I have some weaknesses and insecurities rooted in those weaknesses that are clouding my imagination. For example: Introversion is one of my weaknesses that fosters an insecurity about the reach of my personal network. I'm guessing there are more such weaknesses and I want to spend a round identifying them and brainstorming fixes._
