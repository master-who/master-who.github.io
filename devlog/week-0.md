## Week 0
<br>

This is the work log for the planning week before the SOND'23 trimester. I expect a lot of this work to be walking blind in the dark. More than anything, I'm hoping to find a rhythm in work and hopefully experience zen. Also, this time around, I want to make it fun.

> "Responsible fun" would be a good idea to explore in text

## Monday:

I have till 6pm today which is 8.5 hours from now. The goal today is to build some good momentum. Let's keep the work intervals short to begin with. 25+5 is a good first bet.


__Round 1:__ Structured the plan a little.

__Round 2:__ Started breaking down the objectives into tasks.


_I feel like I have some weaknesses and insecurities rooted in those weaknesses that are clouding my imagination. For example: Introversion is one of my weaknesses that fosters an insecurity about the reach of my personal network. I'm guessing there are more such weaknesses and I want to spend a round identifying them and brainstorming fixes._
    
> Spend a round on executional weaknesses.

__Round 3:__ 
  - Added "About EmptyCup" page on [hq](https://emptycuphq.github.io)
  - Referenced [caring for creativity]()

__Round 4:__ Polished hq further and added new sections

__Round 5:__

I have been thinking about whether this broad approach is the right approach. It is definitely taking me away from launch, scale and more importantly money.

_Wasn't this the bet, I wanted to take before? That having fun will eventually end up being more productive and innovative than following the militant path of rigorous execution?_

Still, I need to learn from my experience on the other side of the equation and my mistakes I made last time I was on this side of the equation. 

_Here's the wisdom that rings true about this time:_

_Be ruthless about doing what you feel like avoiding. Find a fun way of doing it if necessary. If you can't find such a way, commit to doing it and just go through it with a counter or a timer._

_Be patient. Keep at it. Don't keep questioning a direction.Commit and execute._


## Tuesday:

This is tuesday now and I have a different problem.
This may be going too fast for me. I stopped logging yesterday.
Today, I had to muster up all the will power I had to get here.

_Let it flow then_

I have learnt in the past it is better to throttle the flow now than to run wild and fall into a wild bush. Reflect on the dance, so to speak.

_Okay, let's just make sure there are no thorny bushes near by._

What do you have in mind?

_Write a sentence here every 30 minutes._
_Have a white paper and pen handy._
_Stay seated, no matter how uncomfortable._
_Take a breather along with the log._
_Write when the flow starts thinning._
_Move to paper when stuck with writing._


Report on this checklist every 30 minutes.

> I need a script that can do this.

The flow was too strong. I lost track of time. Also, I don't remember when I actually started. So, that's partly my bad. But I did lose track of time in the flow. I submitted to it.

_Even that failed miserably. But, the good thing is I still had good flow._


## Wednesday:


Just hoping to get washed off today by the infinte flow to sweet creativity.
