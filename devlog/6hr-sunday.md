## 6 Hour Sunday
<br>

### Hour 6:

YouTube

### Hour 5:

Meditated

### Hour 4:

Slept

### Hour 3:

Coming back to the challenge of finding an accountant.

_What do we want from the accountant?_

1. Conduct an internal audit of our books.
2. Setup processes to ensure compliance.
3. Consult on automating recurring accounting work.

_Our expectations:_

They should have enough time in the beginning to conduct the audit in a thorough manner.

They should have a strong foundation in accounting to be able to design an internet startup's internal processes.

They should have a clear understanding of Indian corporate law to assess compliance along with practical wisdom of an experienced accountant.

They should have some experience in corporate management to consult on automation ideas for accounting & compliance.

We are looking for mentors / advisors / investors who can help out with this out of passion. We are open to working with smart students or freshers who are looking to build a strong portfolio. Join the brotherhood.

### Hour 2:

Just wrote a mail to a UI/UX Graphic designer who reached for work. Poster calling for beta signups for emptycup3d.com

_I now feel like writing an article titled: "Happiness for money"._


Started writing and spent almost an hour. I'm finding it hard to find the core narrative. This usually happens when you are trying to use a mediu mthat is too rigid. I think I need to first brainstorm the idea on a more free-flowing canvas before fitting a narrative.

_So, the next session on this thread will be brainstorming session with the goal of identifying a narrative connecting an obvious observation to an irrefutable call to action._

### Hour 1:

> I have bootstrapped the work log.
 
Now that the log is setup, let's explore the idea of log driven development. I remember reading about this sometime back being in the same lines as test driven development.

Now, I have to first decide the objective. 

_Let's first enumerate the agenda off the top of my head._

1. Figuring out a hiring plan
2. Getting the tutorials done for the beta version.
3. Documenting product roadmap
4. Documenting company vision for minions
5. Finding an accountant
6. Explore monetising Portfolio
7. Explore monetising a quote generator
8. Reaching 100 paying users

Got sucked into that last exploration for a while there. 

_That's enough. I don't want to spend too much time brainstorming. Let's move on to working on something. Just pick an objective._

Let me pick the one that I hate most. Finding an accountant.

_I'm committing to myself to spend an hour on ways to find an account that are fun._

I'm at a bit of a loss as to where to begin. I have to finish 4 major objectives by the end of this year. So, I decided to stop worrying about where to start and to just start with something.

This first log is a testament to that outcome. 
6 Hours on a Sunday. I'm hoping to just do whatever I feel like.
